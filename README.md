# AutomaticSequences

This Java code was used to prove Theorem 22 of the article _Finding automatic sequences with few correlations_, by Vincent Jugé and Irène Marcovici.

Its documentation is rather elusive, and should be accompanied by this article, notations of which it often uses.
The file **Code24.java** (resp., **Code3.java** and **Code5.java**) is meant to check the cases 2 and 4 (resp., the case 3 and the case 5) of Theorem 22.
It runs over (classes) of block-additive functions of a given rank and, depending of the cases, it tries to prove that they are
1. (a,r)-strongly-2-correlated;
2. 2-correlated;
3. 3-correlated;
4. 4-correlated.
